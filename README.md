# Factorio Mod Portal

This script is a command line tool that downloads factorio mods 
from the official mod portal **even with a non-paid account**

## Announcement
~~As of issue #4 the api this script used has been restricted to paid accounts, so this project has now kinda lost~~
~~its original purpose.~~
~~With the recent new features it's still useful for people with paid accounts to download mods and dependencies automatically,~~
~~so i won't archive the repo yet. Any help in finding another similar workaround is welcome though, in that case please open~~
~~an issue or push a PR and i'll check it out.~~

As of commit 47737b8 i have actually managed to workaround this problem using other mirrors provided by @radioegor146 
(at https://1488.me), thanks a lot :)

## Warning
This project is OLD, it does work and I sporadically fix issues and bugs, but it has several design flaws and if I had the time I would probably rewrite it.
So don't expect too much from it.

## Usage
To execute the tool you need Python 3 installed, you can execute it in the command line using the python interpreter
