# Factorio Mod Portal

This script is a command line tool that downloads factorio mods 
from the official mod portal ~~**even with a non-paid account**~~ 
(only working for paid accounts currently, see <b>EDIT 2</b> in the announcement below).

## Updates
Check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for updates regarding functionality and mirror availability.

## Warning
This project is OLD, it does work and I sporadically fix issues and bugs, but it has several design flaws and if I had the time I would probably rewrite it.
So don't expect too much from it.

## Usage
To execute the tool you need Python 3 installed, first install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the script
```bash
python factoriomod.py
```
