# Factorio Mod Portal

This script is a command line tool that downloads factorio mods 
from the official mod portal even with a non-paid account

## Warning
This project is OLD, it does work and I sporadically fix issues and bugs, but it has several design flaws and if I had the time I would probably rewrite it.
So don't expect too much from it.

## Usage

To execute the tool you need Python 3 installed, you can execute it in the command line using the python interpreter
