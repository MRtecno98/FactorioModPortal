## Updates
~~As of issue #4 the api this script used has been restricted to paid accounts, so this project has now kinda lost~~
~~its original purpose.~~
~~With the recent new features it's still useful for people with paid accounts to download mods and dependencies automatically,~~
~~so i won't archive the repo yet. Any help in finding another similar workaround is welcome though, in that case please open~~
~~an issue or push a PR and i'll check it out.~~

### UPDATE 1: Sep 18 2022
As of commit [47737b8](https://github.com/MRtecno98/FactorioModPortal/commit/47737b8dce319d288b87a20c50a6a25b5e749d27) i have actually managed to workaround this problem using other mirrors provided by @radioegor146 

### UPDATE 2: Nov 21 2023
(at ~~https://1488.me~~), thanks a lot :)
As of recent developments(see issue [#5](https://github.com/MRtecno98/FactorioModPortal/issues/5)) it seems like the other mirrors went down too, possibly because they fixed the googleapis endpoint that was added in commit 
[47737b8](https://github.com/MRtecno98/FactorioModPortal/commit/47737b8dce319d288b87a20c50a6a25b5e749d27)
(see previous update and issue #4 for details), until some other way to download the mods comes up this tool goes back to be only working for paid accounts.

### UPDATE 3: Oct 02 2024
Turns out the domain wasn't deleted, it was just moved to https://re146.dev, so the tool is working again for non-paid accounts, thanks to @Werea25
for the heads up.
